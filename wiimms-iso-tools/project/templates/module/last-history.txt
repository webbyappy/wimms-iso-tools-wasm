wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - New debug command for wit and wwt: ARGTEST: Print all scanned arguments as
   list. This helps to find out wrong parameters, especially for windows.
 - File ./sys/bi2.bin is optional now and will be created if missed.
 - File ./sys/bi2.bin offset 0x30 will be patched for a double layer image
   if the source was a single layer image.
 - Bug fix: Command wit edit --ios=NUMBER did not mark the image as modified,
   so the modified file was not written.
 - Bug fix: If only recursive sources (option --recurse) but no standard
   sources were specified, then "wit EXTRACT" was terminated prematurely.
 - Options --source=PATH and --recurse=PATH support now wildcards. In this
   case PATH is used as search pattern and all found files are added. In order
   to use this variant, the calling shell must not interpret the wildcards.
   Therefore, PATH must usually be enclosed in single or double quotes.
